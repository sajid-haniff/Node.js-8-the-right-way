`watch -n 1 touch target.txt`

- **Command Explanation**: This command uses `watch` to repeatedly execute the `touch` command on `target.txt` every 1 second.
- **Components**:
    - `watch`: A command that runs another command at regular intervals and displays its output.
    - `-n 1`: Specifies the interval in seconds (`1` second in this case) at which `watch` will rerun the specified command.
    - `touch target.txt`: The command being executed repeatedly. `touch` updates the access and modification times of `target.txt` to the current time. If `target.txt` does not exist, it will be created.
- **Use Case**: Commonly used in development environments for tasks like refreshing a file or triggering some action in response to file changes.
